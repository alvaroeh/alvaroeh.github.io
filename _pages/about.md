Hi! I'm Álvaro Espinoza Hernández, economist graduated from Universidad de Chile [(M.Sc., '18)](https://www.magcea-uchile.cl/ex-alumnos/listado-ex-alumnos/), focused in Development, Agricultural and Applied Economics. This is my *personal page*, where I post a relevant part of my work, in the form of abstracts, descriptions and downloadable links to working papers and reports. I frequently give a little more detailed description or a extended abstract in some of the posts, which can be helpful. These repository/blog postings are my way to acknowledge and highlight the collaborative work, discussions and conversations with all the colleagues and professors that have enrichened my journey, and for whom I am always thankful.

Currently I'm a Consultant for the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), working on research projects on agricultural value chains and development in Central American countries.

If you reach here because you want to know a bit more about a paper, or if you want to discuss a related topic that you are working on, please contact me anytime by [Email](mailto:alvaro.espinozah@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to help. I'm looking forward to new opportunities of collaboration with other researchers and economists in research projects (e.g. RCT's, program evaluations, public policy or market analysis), and also interested in participate in consultancy endeavours in Chile and Latin America.
