Hi! I'm Álvaro Espinoza Hernández, economist graduated from Universidad de Chile [(M.Sc., '18)](https://www.magcea-uchile.cl/ex-alumnos/listado-ex-alumnos/), focused on Development, Agricultural and Applied Economics. This is my *personal page*, where I post a relevant part of my work, in the form of abstracts, descriptions and downloadable links to working papers and consultancy projects reports. I frequently give a little more detailed description or a extended abstract in some of the posts, which can be helpful. These repository/blog postings are my way to highlight and acknowledge productive instances of collaboration with colleagues, professors and policymakers that have enrichened my professional journey, and for which I am very thankful.

Currently I'm a Consultant for the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), working on research projects on agricultural value chains and development in Central American countries.

If you reach here because you want to know a bit more about a paper, or if you want to discuss a related topic that you are working on, please contact me anytime by [Email](mailto:alvaro.espinozah@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to help. Maybe this could lead to open new opportunities of collaboration in research projects (RCT's, program evaluations, public policy or market analysis) with other researchers or economists with similar interests in the near future.
