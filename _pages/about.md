Hi, I´m Álvaro Espinoza Hernández, economist graduated from Universidad de Chile (M.Sc., 18'), interested in Development, Agricultural and Applied Economics. This is my *personal page*, where I usually post some of my recent work, in the form of abstracts, descriptions and links to working papers and reports in which I participated. I frequently give a little more detailed description or a extended abstract in some of the posts. I can envision that it is also a good way to highlight the produce of hours of work, discussions and conversations with all the colleagues and professors that have enrichened my journey, and for whom I am always thankful.

I’m looking to involve with other researchers and economists to collaborate in research projects (e.g. RCT's, program evaluations, public policy or market analysis), and interested also in participate in consultancy endeavours in Chile and Latin America. 

I’m currently a Consultant for the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), working on research projects on agricultural value chains and development in Central American countries.
