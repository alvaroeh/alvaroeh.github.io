> This paper presents a complete characterization of market structure in the dry pasta value chain in Chile. Upstream, the agents that participate in commercialization of *durum* wheat, its level of openness to international trade and its degree of linkage with the price index based in international prices used by large processors to buy to local producers of the grain. Likewise, this analysis extends downstream, to the dry pasta manufacturing industry, since *durum* wheat is the main raw input for these foods.

> A review of the main exporting countries is carried out, both for *durum* wheat and pasta and spaghetti, in order to assess influence of international markets that could be relevant in determining the prices from foreign trade operations.

> Subsequently, an assessment of the price index for *durum* wheat consider the objectives defined in its initial design, namely: increased transparency for the agents that participate in the purchase process and if it corresponds to the formation of a competitive market price. In this section, national and international prices of *durum* wheat, pasta and spaghetti are used to assess the degree of linkage between them, as a means of inferring the existence of an integrated global market for these products. The hypotheses proposed are (i) that the referential indicator of national *durum* wheat does not reflect the international price of the grain, (ii) that there is an international market for *durum* wheat integrated into prices; (iii) that the price of products derived from *durum* wheat (pasta and spaghetti) have a structural relationship with the price of the raw material and, (iv) that the international market for pasta and spaghetti disciplines the internal prices of these products. 

> Econometric techniques are applied to the price series stochastic processes to evaluate linear associations between them and non-stationary time series cointegration tests are performed to determine the plausibility of the hypotheses.

> Finally, a discussion is presented on alternative sources of market information to support the national commercialization of *durum* wheat for local producers.
